1. Create a file called solution1.txt and write answers for the following:-
    a) What is the largest positive 32 bit floating point "denormalized" number? Write in bit format.
    b) Write bit notation for the 32 bit floating point "denormalized" number with the samllest absolute value.
    c) Write result of 32 bit floating point addition of 4, -0.375. In particular give the result in bit format.
    d) Write result of 32 bit floating point multiplication of 4, -0.375. In particular give the result in bit format.
    e) Write result of 8 bit floating point multiplication of 1.125, 1.5. In particular give the result in bit format. Use nearest even rounding. An 8 bit floating point number has: 1 bit for S, 4 bits for Exp, 3 bits for frac.

2. The program in code.c was designed to print all the numbers in array "arr". But it does not perform so. Submit a modified "code.c" file which fixes this bug. Add a line or two at the top of the 
file (as a comment) which states the reason as to why did the original file not work correctly.
Keep your soultion as generic as possible i.e. do not simply write printf("%d %d %d %d %d", a[0],a[1],a[2],a[3],a[4]).
